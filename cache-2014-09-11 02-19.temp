These layers contain the boundaries that divide countries into administrative areas such as country, state, county, city, or settlement. These designations vary on a country by country basis. (In the US for example, the AdminBndy2 layer contains State boundaries, the AdminBndy3 layer contains County boundaries, and the AdminBndy4 layer contains City boundaries.) See Administrative Level Coding and Boundary Features in the NAVSTREETS manual for a list of the administrative area types by country. This layer is used for map visualisation. Note that an Administrative Area Boundary is represented by multiple region objects when it has names in multiple languages. This dataset is a subset of the full NAVTEQ NAVSTREETS database.",

    "description" : "This web service layer group contains multiple layers at various scale dependencies which enhances the cartographic display of ecoregion data. Each layer depicts ecoregion features drawn at specific scales as detailed in the layer name. IMPORTANT information regarding proper legend rendering in ArcMap: Due to the limitations of Graphical Device Interface (GDI) resources per application on Windows, ArcMap does not display the legend in the Table of Contents for the ArcGIS Server service layer if the legend has more than 100 items. As of December 2011, there are 968 unique legend items in the Level IV Ecoregion Polygon legend. Follow this link (http:\/\/support.esri.com\/en\/knowledgebase\/techarticles\/detail\/33741) for instructions about how to increase the maximum number of ArcGIS Server service layer legend items allowed for display in ArcMap. Note the instructions at this link provide a slightly incorrect path to \"Maximum Legend Count\". The correct path is HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > ESRI > ArcMap > Server > MapServerLayer > Maximum Legend Count. When editing the \"Maximum Legend Count\", update the field, \"Value data\" to 1000. To download a PDF version of the Level IV ecoregion map and legend, go to ftp:\/\/ftp.epa.gov\/wed\/ecoregions\/us\/Eco_Level_IV_US_pg.pdf. Please read the remainder of this layer description for general information about Level IV Omernik Ecoregions. This layer represents Level IV Omernik Ecoregions. Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. Compilation of the level IV maps, performed at 1:250,000 scale, has been a part of collaborative projects between US Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Laboratory (NHEERL)--Corvallis, OR, the US Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and a variety of other state and federal resource agencies. The ecoregions and subregions are designed to serve as a spatial framework for environmental resource management. The most immediate needs by the states are for developing regional biological criteria and water resource standards, and for setting management goals for nonpoint-source pollution. Level IV ecoregions are intended for large geographic extents (i.e. states, multiple counties, or river basins). Use for smaller areas, such as individual counties or a 1:24,000 scale map boundary, is not recommended. Explanation of the methods used to delineate the ecoregions are given in Omernik (1995), Griffith et al. (1994), and Gallant et al. (1989). For more information about Omernik ecoregions or to download ecoregion maps and GIS data, go to: http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/wed\/pages\/ecoregions.htm.",

Data were provided by the University of Colorado at Boulder (2013) (http:\/\/sealevel.colorado.edu\/), based on measurements from NASA's Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX) and Jason satellite altimeters.\n        The imagery for this web mapping application was generated from an ACII raster file that was provided by EPA to Innovate staff. This conversion was performed using  tools found in ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop 10. The original raster was then modified to remove the one raster cell in central Florida.  This raster cell was in the location of Lake Okeechobee.  To remove this cell the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst tool “IsNull” was used to create a raster that contained two classes of data;  cells with sea level information (output value 0) and the is null cells(output value 1).  This raster was then converted to a polygon feature class (resultant feature class: IsNullPoly).  The cell-polygon in question was then changed from 1 to 0.  This then gave it the same values as the other null polygons.\n        The polygon layer was then reclassified so that all null cells where changed from 1 to 99 and the data cells where changed from 0 to 1. The ArcGIS Data Management Tool – “Dissolve” was then run on the polygon feature class to combine the Lake Okeechobee polygon into the rest of the continental USA (resultant feature class IsNullPoly_Dissolve2_Polygon).\n        The polygon layer was then converted back to a raster using the ArcGIS Conversion Tool – Polygon to Raster (resultant  raster IsNullPoly_Dissolve2_Polygon).  The ArcGIS Spatial Analyst – “Con” tool was then used to created the new SeaLevelAbsoluteEdit Raster. # Replace a layer\/table view name with a path to a dataset (which can be a layer file) or create the layer\/table view within the script # The following inputs are layers or table views: \"IsNullPoly_Dissolve2_Polygon\", \"SeaLevelAbsoluteWebMercator1\" arcpy.Con_sa(\"IsNullPoly_Dissolve2_Polygon\",\"SeaLevelAbsoluteWebMercator1\",\"C:\/Users\/frank\/Documents\/ArcGIS\/Default.gdb\/Con_IsNullPo1\",\"#\",\"\/\\Value\/\\ =1\")",

Data were compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which calculated time series based on monthly values from a network of long-term monitoring stations. Data from individual stations were obtained from the U.S. Historical Climate Network and the Global Historical Climate Network, which are NCDC’s online databases.",

    "description" : "This map illustrates the facilities that reported to the Toxics Release Inventory Program (TRI) in reporting year 2011 and the pounds per year of TRI-listed chemicals released, or disposed of, on land at the facility location. Disposal categories illustrated on the map include: · Underground Injection Class I wells (Section 5.4.1). Disposal in Class I wells includes the emplacement of hazardous and nonhazardous fluids (industrial and municipal wastes) into isolated formations beneath the lowermost underground source of drinking water (USDW). Because they may inject hazardous waste, Class I wells are the most strictly regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and are further regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). · Disposal in Underground Injection Class II-V Wells (Section 5.4.2). The subsurface emplacement of fluids through wells. TRI chemicals associated with manufacturing, the petroleum industry, mining, commercial and service industries, and federal and municipal government-related activities may be injected into Class I, II, III, IV or V wells, if they do not endanger underground sources of drinking water (USDW), public health or the environment. Disposal in Class I wells (see above) are reported separately from disposal in Class II-V wells. o Class II wells are used for injection of brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production. o Class III wells are used for injection of fluids associated with solution mining of minerals. o Class IV wells are used for injection of hazardous or radioactive wastes into or above a USDW and is banned unless authorized under ground water remediation laws. o Class V wells inject nonhazardous fluids into or above a USDW and are typically shallow, onsite disposal systems, such as floor and sink drains which discharge directly or indirectly to ground water, dry wells, leach fields and similar types of drainage wells. Beginning with the 1996 reporting year, facilities report amounts injected into Class I wells separately from amounts injected into all other wells (Class II-V). This change was made to reflect the difference in management standards and regulatory oversight provided by the Underground Injection Control Program for Class I wells as distinguished from other forms of injection reportable to TRI. · RCRA Subtitle C Landfills (Section 5.5.1A). Disposal in RCRA Subtitle C landfills in which wastes are buried. These are landfills that are subject to stringent requirements for liners, leak detection systems and groundwater monitoring. · Other Landfills (Section 5.5.1B). Disposal of toxic chemicals in landfills other than RCRA Subtitle C landfills. Beginning with the 1996 reporting year, facilities report amounts disposed of in RCRA Subtitle C landfills separately from amounts disposed of in other on-site landfills. This change was made to recognize the difference in management and regulatory oversight provided for RCRA Subtitle C landfills. · Land Treatment\/Application Farming (Section 5.5.2). Management techniques in which a waste containing a listed chemical is applied to or incorporated into soil. · RCRA Subtitle C Surface Impoundments (Section 5.5.3A). The total amount of the EPCRA Section 313 chemical that was placed in and remained in (did not volatilize from the impoundment during the reporting year) the RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments. A surface impoundment is a holding area used to volatilize and\/or settle waste materials. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, settling, storage and elevation pits; ponds and lagoons. · Other Surface Impoundments (Section 5.5.3B). The total amount of the EPCRA Section 313 chemical that was placed in surface impoundments other than RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments. Beginning with the 2003 reporting year, facilities report amounts disposed of in RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments separately from amounts disposed of in other on-site surface impoundments. This change was made to recognize the difference in management and regulatory oversight provided for RCRA Subtitle C surface impoundments. · Other Disposal (Section 5.5.4). Other disposal methods including waste piles, spills or leaks.",

This data is intended for mapping purposes only and is not a substitute or replacement for the legal land survey records or other legal documents.\n\nMeasurement and attribute data are collected from survey records using data entry screens into a relational database. The database design is based upon the FGDC Cadastral Content Data Standard. Corner positions are derived by geodetic calculations using measurement records. Closure and edgematching are applied to produce a seamless dataset. The resultant features do not preserve the original geometry of survey measurements, but the record measurements are reported as attributes. Additional boundary data are derived by spatial capture, protraction and GIS processing. The spatial features are stored and managed within the relational database, with active links to the represented measurement and attribute data.",

These waters are listed by the state as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The status of TMDLs are also tracked. TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. What is a total maximum daily load (TMDL)? Water quality standards are set by States, Territories, and Tribes. They identify the uses for each waterbody, for example, drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support (fishing), and the scientific criteria to support that use. A TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing point and nonpoint sources. The calculation must include a margin of safety to ensure that the waterbody can be used for the purposes the state has designated. The calculation must also account for seasonal variation in water quality. The Clean Water Act, section 303, establishes the water quality standards and TMDL programs.",

CIMS is an organized, distributed library of information and software tools designed to increase basin-wide public access to Chesapeake Bay information. The information delivered by CIMS includes technical and public information, educational material, environmental indicators, policy documents, and scientific data. Through the use of relational databases, web-based programming, and web-based GIS a large number of Internet resources have been established. These resources include multiple distributed on-line databases, on-demand graphing and mapping of environmental data, and geographic searching tools for environmental information. Baseline monitoring data, summarized data and environmental indicators that document ecosystem status and trends, confirm linkages between water quality, habitat quality and abundance, and the distribution and integrity of biological populations are also available. One of the major features of the CIMS network is the Chesapeake Bay Program's Data Hub, providing users access to a suite of long- term water quality and living resources databases. Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tidal tributary water quality, benthic macroinvertebrates, toxics, plankton, and fluorescence data can be obtained for a network of over 800 monitoring stations.",

When contaminant levels are unsafe, consumption advisories may recommend that people limit or avoid eating certain species of fish caught in certain places. Every year since 1993, the EPA has made available to the public a compendium of information on locally issued fish advisories and safe eating guidelines. This information is provided to EPA by states, U.S. territories, Indian tribes, and local governments who issue fish consumption advisories and safe eating guidelines to inform people about the recommended level of consumption for fish caught in local waters. Welcome to the EPA's Fish Consumption Advisory website. This website is divided into two main areas: a General Advisory Information area and a Technical Advisory Information area.",

High amounts of agriculture on steep slopes can increase the amount of soil erosion leading to increased sediment in surface water.

    "title" : "California Interagency Watershed Map of 1999 (Calwater 2.2.1)",
    "description" : "The California Interagency Watershed Map of 1999 (updated May 2004, \"calw221\") is the State of California's working definition of watershed boundaries.  Previous Calwater versions (1.2 and 2.2) described California watersheds, beginning with the division of the State's 101 million acres into ten Hydrologic Regions (HR).  Each HR is progressively subdivided into six smaller, nested levels: the Hydrologic Unit (HU, major rivers), Hydrologic Area (HA, major tributaries), Hydrologic Sub-Area (HSA), Super Planning Watershed (SPWS), and Planning Watershed (PWS).   At the Planning Watershed (the most detailed level), where implemented, polygons range in size from approximately 3,000 to 10,000 acres.  At all levels, a total of 7035 polygons represent the State's watersheds.  The present version, Calwater 2.2.1, refines the watershed coding structure and documentation (database fields were added and some were renamed).   There are significant watershed boundary, code, and name differences between Calwater versions 1.2 (1995), 2.0 (1998), and 2.2 (1999).  The differences between versions 2.2 (1999) and 2.2.1 (2004) are attribute field names and some inserted lines that identify differences between State and federal watersheds.\n\n        Calwater 2.2.1 most accurately delineates true watersheds in mountainous terrain.  However, neither Calwater 2.2.1 nor any of its predecessors is a \"pure\" watershed map because administrative boundaries such as the State border were used to delineate watershed areas.  Some of the boundaries, particularly in developed valley areas, also have legal and administrative purposes other than the representation of actual drainage divides.  Examples include the so-called \"Legal Delta\" (California Water Code, Chapter 2, the Delta, Sec. 12220) and other district boundaries.  Neither is Calwater a legal map document, as it does not represent State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) jurisdictions, officiated by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) under California Water Code Section 13200.  Calwater is a hybrid, a spatial cross-reference for use in local, State, and federal information communities.\n\n        The California Resources Agency (CRA) Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) contracted with Tierra Data Systems for the original digital production in 1993, based on Hydrologic Basin Planning Maps  published in hardcopy (SWRCB, 1986).  The State of California Stephen P. Teale Data Center GIS Solutions Group (Teale) under the direction of the California Department of Water Resrouces (DWR) and CDF, finalized the current version in ESRI ArcInfo coverage format in 1999 with USDA Forest Service and RWQCB\/SWRCB inputs. The CRA California Spatial Information Library (CaSIL) is the current distributor of the coverage in the Teale Albers Conical Equal-Area projection, North American Datum of 1983. The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) authored Calwater attribution design and documentation culminating in May 2004 with this Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC-STD-001-1998) standard metadata.",

Substances, particularly chemicals, can have many valid synonyms.  For example, toluene, methyl benzene, and phenyl methane, are commonly used names for the same chemical.  EPA programs collect environmental data for this chemical using each of these names, plus others.  This diversity leads to problems when a user is looking for programmatic data for toluene but is unaware that the data is stored under the synonym methyl benzene.  For each substance, the SRS identifies the statutes, EPA programs, as well as organization external to EPA, that track or regulate that substance and the synonym used by that statute, EPA program or external organization.  Besides standardized information for each chemical, such as the Chemical Abstracts Services name and the Chemical Abstracts Number and the EPA Registry Name (the EPA standard name), the SRS also includes additional information, such as molecular weight and molecular formula.  Additionally, an SRS Internal Tracking Number uniquely identifies each substance, enabling cross-walking between synonyms.  EPA is providing a large .ZIP file providing the SRS data in CSV format, and a separate small metadata file in XML containing the field names and definitions.",

    "description" : "OAR’s RACT, BACT, LAER Clearinghouse (RBLC) data asset contains summary information on selected air permitting actions from EPA, state, and local permitting agencies across the U.S., as well as a number of international permit records supplied by air pollution control agencies in Mexico and Canada. The acronyms refer to program requirements of the New Source Review (NSR) program: RACT is Reasonably Available Control Technology and applies to existing sources in areas that are not meeting national ambient air quality standards (i.e., non-attainment areas); BACT is Best Available Control Technology and applies to major new or modified sources in clean areas (i.e., attainment areas). LAER, or Lowest Achievable Emission Rate, is required on major new or modified sources in non-attainment areas. As of 2012, RBLC includes approximately 6,500 entries. With the exception of LAER permit determinations, whose inclusion in RBLC is mandatory, participation is voluntary. Coverage is therefore not complete or necessarily representative.Required under Section 108 of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, RBLC provides users – typically permit writers, permit applicants or holders, and the public – with references and personal contacts to support ongoing air pollution control activities. Information is detailed enough for users to know whether a permit is applicable to their needs. Users may then contact the appropriate agency to access the permit or discuss it with agency staff.RBLC-referenced permits cover Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), but the data is also searchable for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) references. Entries are generally provided by the original permitting agency, though EPA Regional Offices may enter data on behalf of state and local agencies to augment coverage. Since 2009, Canadian and Mexican agencies have had access to the RBLC to submit their own permit information; all data is provided in English.There are three main levels of information – Facility, Process, and Pollutant. Facility Data includes but is not limited to: Facility Name, City\/Town, State, Permitting Agency, Permit Date, NAICS, SIC, Facility Registry System Number, Permit Number, and Agency Contact Name & Phone Number. Process Data includes but is not limited to: Process Name, Process Type Code, and Throughput. Pollutant Data includes but is not limited to: Pollutant Name, CAS#, Emissions Testing Method(s), Emission Limits, Case-by-Case Basis and any Other Applicable Requirements; and Control Method Description. U.S. geographic coverage includes all states and territories, plus all U.S. permitted facilities within U.S. waters (generally 3 miles for state limits, but further offshore for DOI-permitted oil platforms). Coverage began in 1980, but some historical permits from the 1970s are included. Over the years the data has been converted from paper to searchable digital form. Data is not overwritten, so multiple historical permit references for a single facility may be included. OAQPS manually cross-references RBLC references to the appropriate Facility Registry System (FRS) ID to the extent possible. All RBLC content is public and non-sensitive and available through EPA.gov after it has been quality assured.

Data submitted by manufacturers falls into 12 industries: Heavy Duty Compression Ignition, Marine Spark Ignition, Heavy Duty Spark Ignition, Marine Compression Ignition, Snowmobile, Motorcycle & ATV, Non-Road Compression Ignition, Non-Road Small Spark Ignition, Light-Duty, Evaporative Components, Non-Road Large Spark Ignition, and Locomotive. Title II also requires the collection of fees from manufacturers submitting for compliance certification. Manufacturers submit data on an annual basis, to document engine model changes for certification. Manufacturers also submit compliance information on already certified in-use vehicles randomly selected by the EPA (1) year into their life and (4) years into their life to ensure that emissions systems continue to function appropriately over time.The EPA performs targeted confirmatory tests on approximately 15% of vehicles submitted for certification. Confirmatory data on engines is associated with its corresponding submission data to verify the accuracy of manufacturer submission beyond standard business rules.Section 209 of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act grants the State of California the authority to set its own standards and perform its own compliance certification through the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Currently manufacturers submit compliance information separately to both the EPA and CARB. Currently, data harmonization occurs between EPA data and CARB data only for Motorcycle & ATV submissions.Submitted data comes in XML format or as documents, with the majority of submissions being sent in XML. Data includes descriptive information on the engine itself, as well as on manufacturer testing methods and results. Submissions may include information (CBI) such as information on estimated sales, new technologies, catalysts and calibration, or other data elements indicated by the submitter as confidential. CBI data is not publically available, but it is available within EPA under the restrictions of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) CBI policy [RCS Link]. Pollution emission data covers a range of Criteria Air Pollutants (CAPs) including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Datasets are segmented by vehicle\/engine model and year, with corresponding emission, test, and certification data. Data assets are primarily stored in EPA’s Verify system. Data collected from the Heavy Duty Compression Ignition, Marine Spark Ignition, Heavy Duty Spark Ignition, Marine Compression Ignition, and Snowmobile industries, however, are currently stored in legacy systems the will be migrated to Verify in the future.Coverage began in 1979, with early records being primarily paper documents that did not go through the same level of validation as the digital submissions that began in 2005.Mobile Source Emissions Compliance documents with metadata, certificate and summary decision information is made available to the public through EPA.gov via the OTAQ Document Index System (http:\/\/iaspub.epa.gov\/otaqpub\/).",

    "title" : "Ambient Air Quality Data Inventory",
    "description" : "The Office of Air and Radiation’s (OAR) Ambient Air Quality Data (Current) contains ambient air pollution data collected by EPA, other federal agencies, as well as state, local, and tribal air pollution control agencies. Its component data sets have been collected over the years from approximately 10,000 monitoring sites, of which approximately 5,000 are currently active. OAR’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) and other internal and external users, rely on this data to assess air quality, assist in Attainment\/Non-Attainment designations, evaluate State Implementation Plans for Non-Attainment Areas, perform modeling for permit review analysis, and other air quality management functions.  Air quality information is also used to prepare reports for Congress as mandated by the Clean Air Act. This data covers air quality data collected after 1980, when the Clean Air Act requirements for monitoring were significantly modified. Air quality data from the Agency’s early years (1970s) remains available (see OAR PRIMARY DATA ASSET: Ambient Air Quality Data -- Historical), but because of technical and definitional differences the two data assets are not directly comparable. The Clean Air Act of 1970 provided initial authority for monitoring air quality for Conventional Air Pollutants (CAPs) for which EPA has promulgated National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Requirements for monitoring visibility-related parameters were added in 1977. Requirements for monitoring acid deposition and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) were added in 1990. Most monitoring sites contain multiple instruments. Most also report meteorological data, including wind speed and direction, humidity, atmospheric pressure, inbound solar radiation, precipitation and other factors relevant to air quality analysis. The current system of sites represents a number of independently-defined monitoring networks with different regulatory or scientific purposes, such as the State and Local Air Monitoring System, the National Air Toxics Trends sites, the Urban Air Toxics sites, the IMPROVE visibility monitoring network, the air toxics monitoring sites for schools, and others. (A complete list of air quality monitoring networks is available at http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/???). Efforts are under way through NCore Multipollutant Monitoring Network (http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ttnamti1\/ncore\/index.html) to streamline and integrate advanced air quality measurement systems to minimize costs of data collection. Measurements and estimates from these networks are collected across the entire U.S., including all states and territories, with emphasis on documenting pollutant exposures in populated areas.Sampling frequencies vary by pollutant (hourly, 3- and 8-hour, daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual measurements), as required by different NAAQS. Some 50,000 measurements per day are added to the EPA’s central air quality data repository, the Air Quality System (AQS). All data, including meteorological information, is public and non-confidential and available through the AQS Data Mart (http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/ttn\/airs\/aqsdatamart\/). Generally, data for one calendar quarter are reported by the end of the following quarter; some values may be subsequently changed due to quality assurance activities.",

The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities. The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).",

    "description" : "This point shapefile is a subset of the US National dataset clipped to the area of the Navajo Nation.\n\n        The National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) program was initiated by the Atomic Energy Commission (now the Department of Energy; DOE) in 1973 with a primary goal of identifying uranium resources in the United States.  The Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (HSSR) program was one of nine components of NURE.  Planned systematic sampling of stream sediments, soils, groundwater, and surface water over the entire United States began in 1975 under the responsibility of four DOE national laboratories: Lawrence Livermore Laboratory (LLL), Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP), and Savannah River Laboratory (SRL). Each DOE laboratory developed its own sample collection, analytical, and data management methodologies and hired contractors to collect the samples.\n\n        The NURE HSSR sampling program ended prematurely in 1980.  The samples were analyzed and the resultant geochemical data were released on 9-track tapes and in a series of publications.  By 1984, the NURE program was finished as Congressional funding disappeared. Out of a total of 625 2-degree quadrangles that cover the entire lower 48 States and Alaska, only 307 quadrangles were completely sampled and another 86 quadrangles were partially sampled. The HSSR data consisted of 894 separate data files stored on magnetic tape in 47 different file formats.\n\n        The University of Oklahoma's Information Systems Programs of the Energy Resources Institute (ISP) was contracted by the Department of Energy to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of the NURE HSSR data. ISP created a single standard-format master file to replace 894 original files. ISP converted only 817 of the 894 original files before their funding ended.  Unfortunately, this conversion process was never completed and introduced several systematic errors into the database.\n\n        In 1985, the NURE HSSR sample archive, original field maps, field notes, and data tapes became the responsibility of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).  A copy of the ISP-formatted NURE HSSR database was released as two CD-ROM publications (Hoffman and Buttleman, 1994; 1996).\n\n        A new effort to recompile the NURE HSSR was begun by the USGS in 1995.  All of the original 894 files have been examined, reformatted, and added to this USGS enhanced version of the NURE HSSR data.  The data are contained in 2 major database files: one for water samples and one for sediment samples (which also includes soil and some rock samples.)

Similar geologic units were correlated only along state boundaries to facilitate edge matching.  Correlation and merging of units along state boundaries was based on similar age and characteristics of units.  Landsat TM images were geologically interpreted to facilitate accurate mapping and edge matching along state boundaries.  Whenever possible existing state specific geologic detail was maintained.  Soil substrate classification was derived from a 1:500,000 scale geologic coverage using a modified soil classification scheme developed by NatureServe.\n\n        Soil substrate codes and geology were correlated based of bulk rock chemical compositions and characteristics.  Soil substrate codes are as follows:  QYA = Quaternary age younger alluvium and surficial deposits,  QOA = Quaternary age older alluvium and surficial deposits,  EOS = Unconsolidated Aeolian sand deposits both active and stabilized,  SND = Sandstone dominated formations of all ages,  SLM = Siltstone and\/or mudstone dominated formations of all ages, SHL = Shale dominated formations of all ages, CLM = Carbonate dominated formations either limestone or dolomites of all ages, EVP = Evaporite units either halite, gypsum, or other saline mineral dominated formations of all ages, GSL = Metamorphic or igneous units with a dominantly silicic composition all ages,   BMC = Metamorphic or igneous units with dominantly mafic composition all ages, H20 = Water, and UNK= unable to assign a substrate type.\n\n        This polygon shapefile was clipped to the area of the Navajo Nation and attributes for Age, Rock Type, and concatenated Age and Rock Type, along with a numeric code for SUBS_CODE.",

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM survey plats\/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey firms, and local governments. The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land Description (LLD) data set, contained within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records system. The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast & Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) Cooperative Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official survey data for any given geographic area. The Land Survey Information System Data Base (LSIS) data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data served from LSIS is not a substitute for a legal land survey.",

The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

    "description" : "This data was collected by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in New Mexico at both the New Mexico State Office and at the various field offices.  This dataset is meant to depict the surface owner or manager of the land parcels.  In the vast majority of land parcels, they will be one and the same.  However, there are instances where the owner and manager of the land surface are not the same.  When this occurs, the manager of the land is usually indicated.\n        BLM's Master Title Plats are the official land records of the federal government and serve as the primary data source for depiction of all federal lands. Information from State of New Mexico is the primary source for the depiction of all state lands.  Auxilliary source are referenced, as well, for the depiction of all lands.\n        Collection of this dataset began in the 1980's using the BLM's ADS software to digitize information at the 1:24,000 scale.  In the mid to late 1990's the data was converted from ADS to ArcInfo software and merged into tiles of one degree of longitude by one half degree of latitude.  These tiles were regularly updated.  The tiles were merged into a statewide coverage.  The source geodatabase for this shapefile was created by loading the merged ArcInfo coverage into a personal geodatabase.  The geodatabase data were snapped to a more accurate GCDB derived land network, where available.  In areas where GCDB was not available the data were snapped to digitized PLSS.  This shapefile has been created by exporting the geodatabase feature class.",

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000\/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters.  Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory.  These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.\n\n        By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.  Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).\n\n        Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands.  These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters.  Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory.  These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.\n\n        By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.  Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",

TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. What is a total maximum daily load (TMDL)? Water quality standards are set by States, Territories, and Tribes. They identify the uses for each waterbody, for example, drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support (fishing), and the scientific criteria to support that use. A TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing point and nonpoint sources. The calculation must include a margin of safety to ensure that the waterbody can be used for the purposes the state has designated. The calculation must also account for seasonal variation in water quality. The Clean Water Act, section 303, establishes the water quality standards and TMDL programs.",

The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main sub-layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the sustainability layer which describes the state of the environment in terms of stability (sustainble areas are those that can maintain themselves into the future without human management). There are eleven measures that make up the sustainability layer: contiguous land cover, regularity of ecosystem boundary, appropriateness of land cover, waterway obstruction, road density, airport noise, Superfund sites, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sites, water quality, air quality, and urban\/agriculture disturbance. Each cell in the final sustainability grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the eleven measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more sustainable. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least sustainable. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (highest 1% of scores), 10 (highest 2 to 10% of scores), 25 (highest 11 to 25% of scores), 50 (highest 26 to 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores). Those cells with a value of 1 represent the areas that have the highest rarity. Those with a value of 100 represent those areas that have the lowest rarity.\n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

    "description" : "The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is a screening level assessment tool created by a working group of the Texas Environmental Resource Stewards (TERS). The TEAP divides nineteen individual measures into three main layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the rarity layer which shows the rarity of species and land cover in Texas. There are four measures that make up the rarity layer: vegetation rarity, natural heritage rank, taxonomic richness, and rare species richness. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the four measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that have the most rarity. Cells with lower scores represent areas that have the least rarity. \n\nTERS was established in July 2002 to seek greater Federal and State interagency collaboration on identifying and supporting joint priorities, particularly regarding transportation issues. Leaders from participating agencies (see Supplemental Information) jointly identified common interests and target activities for collaborative ecosystem management, thereby benefitting each agency. Common interests and uses included identification of highest priority natural resources areas (wetland, aquatic, terrestrial) for avoidance, mitigation, or potential compensation or restoration; \"streamlining\" of regulatory processes; early assistance with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) planning; and analysis of cumulative impacts. TERS participants also identified uses for the TERS ecological assessment within each agency's mission. The vision, as developed by the TERS executives, included the following actions: Improve mutual understanding; Use collective knowledge to support decisions-making; and Strive for synergism. The TERS approach to achieving this vision was to use an ecosystem approach to organize strategies that achieve effective and measurable environmental results, and jointly communicate the results to the public. The initial goals of TERS were to identify high priority ecological areas, potential mitigation areas, and streamline the regulatory processes. The Texas Ecological Assessment Protocol (TEAP) is part of the first goal: the ecological assessment and identification of priority ecological resources in the state of Texas.

The data is at the block group level.  Each field for each block group is assigned an index score of 0-3, based on whether the value of that dataset falls in the top quartile (score=3), second quartile (score=2), third quartile (score=1), or bottom quartile (score=0).  The scores for each field are then added together to assign a comprehensive score  to each block group (0-21).  The highest scores are block groups that have the highest percentage of sensitive populations (highest percent minority, lowest per capita income, highest percent of population under 18 and over 64, highest percentage of population without a high school degree, highest percent of linguistically isolated households, and highest percent of single female head of households).

Water systems may use surface water sources or groundwater sources as a source of water to meet its customers needs. These systems also may use multiple facilties at different physical locations to collect, treat, and distribute the drinking water to these customers. Types of facilities may include surface water intakes on rivers, treatment plants, and groundwater wells located at various physical locations. For the purposes of this metadata document, and the downloadable file it describes, the terms \"facility\/facilities\" are equivalent to the term \"source\/sources\". Attributes are included in this table to assist in generating aggregated subwatershed (HUC12) indicators so that all facilities can be further stratified into various subsets. Stratifier attributes include a field indicating where a facility draws on surface water or groundwater source water, whether a facility is part of a community water system, or is one of two types of non-community systems. Stratifiers are also related to the size of the community served by the public water system associated with a facility. This table, or derived HUC12 indicator products, can be mapped through setting up appropriate table relations on the attribute \"HUC_12\" with the HUC12 GIS layer that is part of EPA's Reach Address Database (RAD) Version 3. At the present time, the RAD Version 3 contains HUC12 polygons for the conterminous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (materials for Alaska or for other territories and dependencies are not available as of February, 2010).",

The Water Quality Standards' Designated Uses are able to be linked to tables of water quality criteria which are located in EPA's Water Quality Standards Database. Water Quality Standards events are indexed onto National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) reaches to create NHD area, linear and point events. Point events are attached to a reach in NHD for many reasons: to represent an estuary; represent a drinking water intake point; or to represent a designated use when there is no reachcode in the NHD to represent that feature. In addition to NHD reach indexed data there may also be custom events (point, line, or polygon) that are not associated with the medium resolution NHD and are in an EPA standard format that is compatible with EPA's Reach Address Database. These custom datafiles are used to represent Water Quality Standards that are not represented well or at all in the NHD.",

    "description" : "The EPA Recovery Mapper is an Internet interactive mapping application that allows users to discover information about every American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) award that EPA has funded for six programs. By integrating data reported by the recipients of Recovery Act funding and data created by EPA, this application delivers a level of transparency and public accessibility to users interested in EPA's use of Recovery Act monies. The application is relatively easy to use and builds on the same mapping model as Google, Bing, MapQuest and other commonly used mapping interfaces. EPA Recovery Mapper tracks each award made by each program and gives basic Quick Facts information for each award including award name, location, award date, dollar amounts and more. Data Summaries for each EPA program or for each state are provided displaying dollars for Total Awarded, Total Received (Paid), and Total Jobs This Quarter by Recovery for the latest quarter of data released by Recovery.gov. The data are reported to the government and EPA four times a year by the award recipients. The latest quarterly report will always be displayed in the EPA Recovery Mapper. In addition, the application provides many details about each award. Users will learn more about how to access and interpret these data later in this document. Data shown in the EPA Recovery Mapper are derived from information reported back to FederalReporting.gov from the recipients of Recovery Act funding. EPA reviews the recipient reported data and works with the recipients to correct the data when errors are found. Please note that the dollar amounts displayed at Recovery.gov may differ somewhat from the amounts in this application because EPA Recovery Mapper includes awards that EPA has funded for Superfund sites cleanups that were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Also, EPA Recovery Mapper also does not display awards for management and oversight and awards made to EPA's Inspector General which account for less than 1.4% of the Recovery Act funding that EPA has received.",

    "description" : "EPAs public geospatial metadata service provides external parties (Geospatial One Stop [GOS], Data.gov, and the National Spatial Data Infrastructure [NSDI], and the general public) with access to EPA's geospatial metadata records.  This service is an ArcIMS Metadata service, and is accessible to users directly through the use of ArcCatalog, or indirectly by searching GOS, Data.gov, or the NSDI.  It provides the public with access to key EPA geospatial metadata records, including records describing facility data, emergency response data, and other environmental data.   Geospatial metadata records are harvested to this central location from  EPA’s distributed regional and program offices.  The metadata records provided at this service are organized into different collections\/folders that are managed by these different EPA offices.  Each of the collections is visible as a folder in the ArcIMS Metadata Service and the geospatial metadata can be viewed by opening each of the folders.  To connect to this service using ArcCatalog, click on Add ArcIMS Server and enter http:\/\/edg.epa.gov into the URL entry within the form.  Either add all services, or select the Public_Metadata service from the list. These records are also available at EPA's Web Accessible Folder (WAF).  The URL for the WAF is  https:\/\/edg.epa.gov\/metadata\/waf. This WAF contains xml versions of all the public metadata records listed at EPA's ArcIMS Metadata Service. Select an individual record to view the complete metadata record. EPA also provides access to these records using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)-compliant Catalog Service for the Web (CSW) interface.  The instructions and URL for accessing EPA's public geospatial metadata catalog using this method is available at http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/geospatial\/data.html. If you would like to view all EPA resources that are made available at GOS, please go to the 'Advanced Search', click on the Publisher category and select U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from the Partner Collection dropdown.  This will provide you with access to all metadata records contributed to GOS by the EPA.  You may also find many of EPA's resources highlighted within the Environment and Conservation Channel.",

HF is used by gas producers to stimulate wells and recover natural gas from sources such as coalbeds and shale gas formations. HF is also used for other applications including oil recovery. Over the past few years, several key technical, economic, and energy policy developments have spurred increased use of HF for gas extraction over a wider diversity of geographic regions and geologic formations. It is projected that shale gas will comprise over 20% of the total US gas supply by 2020 (PDF) (230 pp, 2MB, About PDF). Along with the expansion of HF, there has been increasing concerns about its potential impacts on drinking water resources, public health, and environmental impacts in the vicinity of these facilities.",

    "description" : "Public Water System location points, based on information from the Safe Drinking Water Act Information System (SDWIS\/Federal) for a 2010 third quarter (SDWIS_2010Q3) baseline period, were applied to relate system latitude and longitude coordinates to Watershed Boundary Dataset subwatershed polygons (HUC12s). Other attributes are included in this table to assist in generating aggregated subwatershed (HUC12) indicators so that all systems can be further stratified into various subsets. Stratifier attributes include a field indicating where a system draws primarily on surface water or groundwater source water, whether a system is a community water system, or is one of two types of non-community systems. Stratifiers are also related to the size of the community served by the public water system. This table, or derived HUC12 indicator products, can be mapped through setting up appropriate table relationships on the attribute \"HUC_12\" with the HUC12 GIS layer that is part of EPA's Reach Address Database (RAD) Version 3. At the present time, the RAD Version 3 contains HUC12 polygons for the conterminous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (materials for Alaska or for other territories and dependencies are not available as of February, 2010). The records in this table are based on a special QUERY created by the EPA Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW) from the primary SDWIS\/FED information to provide a robust point representation for a PWS system. PWS points are selected based on the following prioritization: 1. If the system has a treatment plant with LatLongs and MAD codes; 2. If the system has a treatment plant with LatLongs but without MAD codes; 3. If the system has a well with LatLongs and MAD codes; 4. If the system has a well with LatLongs but without MAD codes; 5. If the system has an intake with LatLongs and MAD codes; 6. If the system has an intake with LatLongs but without MAD codes; 7. If the system has any source with LatLongs and MAD codes; 8. If the system has any source with LatLongs but without MAD codes. Note: Public water systems and the populations served by the systems may not be located within the same HUC12 as the sources of drinking water.",

    "description" : "The NHDPlus Version 1.0 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainageenforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building \"walls\" using the national WatershedBoundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model(HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHDand WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the lasttwo years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; subset a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes.The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and land cover distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs.NHDPlus contains a snapshot (2005) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved. While these updates will eventually make their way back to the central NHD repository at USGS, this will not have happened prior to distribution of NHDPlus because the update process for the central NHD repository is still in development. Consequently, the NHDPlus will contain some temporary database keys and, as a result, NHDPlus users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlus with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS.

The REAP divides eighteen individual measures into three main sub-layers: diversity, rarity, and sustainability. This feature class represents the diversity layer which shows land cover continuity and diversity. There are three measures that make up the diversity layer: appropriateness of land cover, contiguous size of undeveloped area, and the Shannon land cover diversity index. Each cell in the final diversity grid has a score of between 1 and 100 based on the average of the three measures. Cells with higher scores represent areas that are more diverse. Cells with lower scores represent areas that are the least diverse. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (top 1% of scores), 10 (top 10% of scores), 25 (top 25% of scores), 50 (top 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores).",

The results from the diversity, rarity, and sustainability layers are summed to create the composite grid with scores potentially ranging from 3 to 300. The higher scores represent areas that may be of a higher ecological importance. In this feature class the cells are placed into the following 5 groups based on the score: 1 (top 1% of scores), 10 (top 10% of scores), 25 (top 25% of scores), 50 (top 50% of scores), and 100 (all the rest of the scores).",

Data provide a vector polygon GIS layer showing available materials representing extents at the land surface related to 78 designated Sole Source Aquifers (SSA) related to announcements in the Federal Register. GIS coverages for SSAs were obtained from EPA Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 for a baseline period in September of 2009. Each SSA polygon was checked against the Federal Register (FR) determination for that SSA. These coverages were appended, in order to create a national seamless coverage of SSAs.  There are 89 GIS polygons for the Sole Source Aquifers, since in addition to a single SSA designated area polygons, some Regions have delineated GIS layers for streamflow zones, aquifer recharge areas, and other features at the land surface important for the SSA designations.  GIS materials are not available at this time for the St. Joseph SSA in Indiana [53 FR 23682 (1988)].

NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building \"walls\" using the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD).

Combined sewer systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater in the same pipe. Most of the time, combined sewer systems transport all of their wastewater to a sewage treatment plant, where it is treated and then discharged to a water body. During periods of heavy rainfall or snowmelt, however, the wastewater volume in a combined sewer system can exceed the capacity of the sewer system or treatment plant. For this reason, combined sewer systems are designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.",

    "description" : "The NHDPlus Version 1.0 is an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial data sets that incorporate many of the best features of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainage enforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building \"walls\" using the national Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model (HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHD and WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the last two years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.",

Note the CWA Section 303(d) list of impaired waters does not represent waters that are impaired but have an EPA-approved TMDL established, impaired waters for which other pollution control mechanisms are in place and expected to attain water quality standards, or waters impaired as a result of pollution and is not caused by a pollutant; therefore, the \"Impaired Waters\" layers do not represent all impaired waters reported in a state's Integrated Report, but only the waters comprised of a state's approved 303(d) list. For more information regarding impaired waters refer to EPA's Integrated Reporting Guidance at: http:\/\/www.epa.gov\/owow\/tmdl\/guidance.html 303(d) Waterbodies are coded onto NHD linear and area features to create Linear, Polygonal and Point Events. Point events represent impaired waterbody segments that do not fall on an NHD reach. 303(d) Waterbodies are coded onto NHD Waterbody reaches (region.rch) to create datasets. In addition to NHD reach indexed data there may also be custom event data (point, line, or polygon) that are not associated with NHD and are in an EPA standard format that is compatible with EPA's Reach Address Database. These custom features are used to represent locations of 303(d) waterbodies that are not represented well in NHD.\n\nThe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Tracking System contains information on waters that are Not Supporting their designated uses. These waters are listed by the state as impaired under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. The status of TMDLs are also tracked. TMDLs are pollution control measures that reduce the discharge of pollutants into impaired waters. A TMDL or Total Maximum Daily Load is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's sources. What is a total maximum daily load (TMDL)? Water quality standards are set by States, Territories, and Tribes. They identify the uses for each waterbody, for example, drinking water supply, contact recreation (swimming), and aquatic life support (fishing), and the scientific criteria to support that use. A TMDL is the sum of the allowable loads of a single pollutant from all contributing point and nonpoint sources. The calculation must include a margin of safety to ensure that the waterbody can be used for the purposes the state has designated. The calculation must also account for seasonal variation in water quality. The Clean Water Act, section 303, establishes the water quality standards and TMDL programs.",

The EnviroMapper Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) dataset contains information from the CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) database. The CBR database contains data provided by state CWSRF programs on the environmental benefits achieved by CWSRF assistance. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund was created in 1987 by Congress with the intent of providing States with a continuous source of funding to address water quality projects. Beginning in 1988, the CWSRF annually awards capitalization grants to all 50 States and Puerto Rico to support their independently-operated State Revolving Funds. The CWSRF provides low-interest loans, generally at 2-3%, to a wide range of borrowers including municipalities, State Agencies, and individuals. These loans have predominantly been used to maintain and improve publicly owned treatment works, mitigate non-point source pollution, and promote estuary management. The EnviroMapper Clean Water State Revolving Fund dataset contains information on CWSRF assistance provided to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) after January 1, 2005. For states that provided data for POTWs that received CWSRF assistance prior to January 1, 2005, that data has been included also. The Clean Water State Revolving Fund Benefits Reporting (CBR) system is used by EPA and State Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) programs to track and report on the environmental progress of the CWSRF program.",

The NHDPlus includes a stream network (based on the 1:100,000-scale NHD), improved networking, naming, and \"value-added attributes\" (VAA's). NHDPlus also includes elevation-derived catchments (drainage areas) produced using a drainageenforcement technique first broadly applied in New England, and thus dubbed \"The New-England Method\". This technique involves \"burning-in\" the 1:100,000-scale NHD and when available building \"walls\" using the national WatershedBoundary Dataset (WBD). The resulting modified digital elevation model(HydroDEM) is used to produce hydrologic derivatives that agree with the NHDand WBD. An interdisciplinary team from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and contractors, over the lasttwo years has found this method to produce the best quality NHD catchments using an automated process.The VAAs include greatly enhanced capabilities for upstream and downstream navigation, analysis and modeling. Examples include: retrieve all flowlines (predominantly confluence-to-confluence stream segments) and catchments upstream of a given flowline using queries rather than by slower flowline-by flowline navigation; retrieve flowlines by stream order; subset a stream level path sorted in hydrologic order for stream profile mapping, analysis and plotting; and, calculate cumulative catchment attributes using streamlined VAA hydrologic sequencing routing attributes.The VAAs include results from the use of these cumulative routing techniques, including cumulative drainage areas, precipitation, temperature, and land cover distributions. Several of these cumulative attributes are used to estimate mean annual flow and velocity as part of the VAAs.NHDPlus contains a snapshot (2005) of the 1:100,000-scale NHD that has been extensively improved. While these updates will eventually make their way back to the central NHD repository at USGS, this will not have happened prior to distribution of NHDPlus because the update process for the central NHD repository is still in development. Consequently, the NHDPlus will contain some temporary database keys and, as a result, NHDPlus users may not make updates to the NHD portions of NHDPlus with the intent of sending these updates back to the USGS. Once the NHDPlus updates have been posted to the central NHD repository, a fresh copy of the improved data can be downloaded from the central NHD repository and that copy will be usable for data maintenance. Note that the NHDPlus products are tightly integrated and user modifications to the underlying NHD can compromise this synchronization.",

The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the millions of stream segments or reaches that comprise the Nations' surface water drainage system. The NHD provides a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water quality related entities, such as fish advisories locations. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network in a manner similar to street addresses. The assignment of reach addresses is accomplished through a process known as reach indexing.  Fish consumption advisories and fish tissue sampling stations are reported to EPA by the states. Sampling stations are the locations where a state has collected fish tissue data for use in advisory determinations. Fish consumption advisory locations are coded onto route.drain (Transport and Coastline Reach) features of the NHD to create Point Events and Linear Events. Fish consumption advisory locations are also coded onto region.rch (Waterbody Reach) features of the NHD to create NHD Waterbody Datasets. In addition to NHD-reach indexed data, there may also be custom events (point, line, or polygon) that are not associated with NHD.  Although these Fish consumption advisories are not represented in the NHD, the data created for them are in an EPA standard format that is compatible with EPA's Reach Address Database.",

    "description" : "Background: Chemical toxicity testing is being transformed by advances in biology and computer modeling, concerns over animal use and the thousands of environmental chemicals lacking toxicity data. EPA's ToxCast program aims to address these concerns by screening and prioritizing chemicals for potential human toxicity using in vitro assays and in silico approaches. Objectives: This project aims to evaluate the use of in vitro assays for understanding the types of molecular and pathway perturbations caused by environmental chemicals and to build initial prioritization models of in vivo toxicity. Methods: We tested 309 mostly pesticide active chemicals in 467 assays across 9 technologies, including high-throughput cell-free assays and cell-based assays in multiple human primary cells and cell lines, plus rat primary hepatocytes. Both individual and composite scores for effects on genes and pathways were analyzed. Results: Chemicals display a broad spectrum of activity at the molecular and pathway levels. Many expected interactions are seen, including endocrine and xenobiotic metabolism enzyme activity. Chemicals range in promiscuity across pathways, from no activity to affecting dozens of pathways. We find a statistically significant inverse association between the number of pathways perturbed by a chemical at low in vitro concentrations and the lowest in vivo dose at which a chemical causes toxicity. We also find associations between a small set in vitro assays and rodent liver lesion formation. Conclusions: This approach promises to provide meaningful data on the thousands of untested environmental chemicals, and to guide targeted testing of environmental contaminants.",

Rather, it represents a subset of enforcement cases, taken civil judicially or administratively, which may be of national interest.  Most of the settlements are civil judicial consent decrees resolving alleged violations of environmental laws (e.g., the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act).  In some instances, the website includes significant enforcement actions resolved by the Environmental Appeals Board (EAB). In addition, please note that the cases and settlements webpage does not include:Most administrative enforcement actions; Most civil judicial cases resolving liability under CERCLA; Criminal enforcement matters.",

Administrative Law Judges preside in enforcement and permit proceedings in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.

The Decisions and Orders are organized into three categories: (1) alphabetical listing by the respondent involved, (2) reverse chronological listing by date, and (3) Decisions and Orders under FIFRA Section 6. This dataset includes Decisions and Orders dating back to 1989 in the Reverse Chronological list, Decisions and Orders dating back to 1997 in the Alphabetical list, and a few Decisions and Orders dating back to 1974 under FIFRA Section 6.",
